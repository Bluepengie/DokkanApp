# DokkanApp 

DokkanApp (name *extremely* tentative) is a long term project that intends to eventually be a tool to analyze and quantify the effectiveness of units in Dokkan Battle (given my susceptibility to scopecreep, this is an inentionally vague description).

# Planned(?) Features:

* Calculate a unit's APT (or similar metric) given their card details
* Calculate a unit's effective defensive stat given their card details
* Autofill the information fields given a link to a unit's wiki page
* Suggest an optimal Hidden Potential build for both offense and defense
* Team building suggestions
